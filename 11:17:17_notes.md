# Database Management Systems
* Keep track and perform calculations on tables
* You could use filter and map to build sql
* Where would use filter
* Select would use map over certain rows
* sometimes the query happens in a different order, because it is more efficient
* Query optimization is very thought out

# Query planning
* the manner in which the tables are flittered, sorted, and joined affects execution time.
* sorting tables before doing operations on them by a common parameter can significantly decrease the time of calculation

# Local Tables
* create table statement creates it globally
```
with best(dog) as (
  select "eisenhower" union
  select "barack"
  )
```
local table bst, with the column dog
